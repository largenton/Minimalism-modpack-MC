Minimal modpack aimed at lightness not only in weight but also in use,
This modpack contains only what is needed for new versions in both single player and multiplayer worlds. Not only new versions are supported(Not soon), BUT the relevance of mods may be in question.

**FAQ**:

Q: configured?

A: No, set it up yourself. There is a mod menu, as well as hands. Everyone has their own taste

Q: Will snapshots be supported?

A:questionable

Q: Support for older versions?

A: I think that over time I will add from 1.19 to 1.18 and older (here, by the way, fabric will be used!)

Q: current versions of mods??

A: Not all mods still support versions like 1.18, let alone 1.16 or 1.15.

Q How to support the modpack?

A: No, better support the creators of mods

Q: Something went wrong!

A: You can send me a log, but preferably to the creators!
